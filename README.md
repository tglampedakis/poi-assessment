So in order to build and run the application you simply need to setup a local Postgres DB

You can find the initial queries that have been executed in the file under:
src\main\resources\db

After that, with the power and help of Maven you should be fine

Nothing too fancy was implemented :)

In any case, feel free to contact me

Java 11 was used (mainly due to TomEE - tried to avoid any incompatibilities with later Java versions)
